# United Drug Abatement Portal
## Overview
With a commitment to maintaining a safe and secure workplace, United Airlines' Drug Abatement Team has initiated the development of a comprehensive drug screening request system. This React-based project streamlines the submission, approval, and management of drug screening forms, enhancing the efficiency and user experience for both supervisors and administrators.

## Client Organization 
United Airlines, a global leader in air travel, houses various departments crucial to its seamless functioning. The Drug Abatement Team under Digital Technology focuses on enforcing company policies related to substance abuse in the workplace. This project addresses challenges in the current drug screening request system, aiming for a more standardized and user-friendly approach.

## Project Team
The project is a collaborative effort by four undergraduate students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, each bringing unique skill sets to the project:

Emily Ngo: Project Manager
Chloe Jepson: Back-End Developer
Jialin Yu: Front-End Developer
James Liu: Full-Stack Developer
Problem Statement
The existing drug screening request system faces challenges in functionality and user experience. Manual data entry, lack of uniformity, and a desktop-only application contribute to inefficiencies. The Drug Abatement Compliance Portal addresses these issues, providing a streamlined, standardized, and user-friendly solution.

## User Challenges
Supervisors, the primary users, encounter challenges in the current application, leading to inefficiencies and errors. The manual nature of the process and desktop-only access create delays, especially in critical situations. The new system aims to overcome these challenges by offering a digitized, user-friendly interface accessible across various devices.
