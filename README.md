# United Drug Abatement Portal
## Overview
With a commitment to maintaining a safe and secure workplace, United Airlines' Drug Abatement Team has initiated the development of a comprehensive drug screening request system. This React-based project streamlines the submission, approval, and management of drug screening forms, enhancing user experience for both supervisors and administrators.


## Client Organization 
United Airlines, a global leader in air travel, houses various departments crucial to its seamless functioning. The Drug Abatement Team under Digital Technology focuses on enforcing company policies related to substance abuse in the workplace. This project addresses challenges in the current drug screening request system, aiming for a more standardized and user-friendly approach.


## Our Team
The project is a collaborative effort by four undergraduate students from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, each bringing unique skill sets to the project:<br />

Emily Ngo: Project Manager<br />
Chloe Jepson: Back-End Developer<br />
Jialin Yu: Front-End Developer<br />
James Liu: Full-Stack Developer<br />


## Challenges With the Existing System
The existing drug screening request system faces challenges in functionality and user experience. Manual data entry, lack of uniformity, and a desktop-only application contribute to inefficiencies. The new system aims to overcome these challenges by offering a digitized, user-friendly interface accessible across various devices.
